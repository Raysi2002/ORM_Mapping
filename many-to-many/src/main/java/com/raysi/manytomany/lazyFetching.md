# Lazy Fetching in Hibernate and Spring Boot

Lazy fetching is a technique in Hibernate and JPA where associated data is not fetched from the database until it is explicitly accessed. This approach is useful for optimizing performance, especially when dealing with large datasets or entities with multiple associations.

## Key Concepts

### Lazy vs. Eager Fetching

- **Lazy Fetching**: Associated data is fetched only when accessed.

    - Example: If an entity `Order` has a `List<Item>`, the items will not be fetched when the `Order` is loaded but only when `getItems()` is called.

- **Eager Fetching**: Associated data is fetched immediately along with the main entity.

    - Example: The `List<Item>` will be fetched when the `Order` is loaded, even if `getItems()` is not called.

### Why Use Lazy Fetching?

- **Performance**: Reduces the initial data load from the database.
- **Scalability**: Prevents loading unnecessary data, especially for large associations.
- **Flexibility**: Allows control over when and how associated data is fetched.

## How Lazy Fetching Works

In Hibernate, lazy fetching is enabled by default for `@OneToMany` and `@ManyToMany` associations. You can explicitly set lazy fetching for other relationships using the `fetch` attribute in annotations.

### Example

```java
@Entity
public class Order {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String customerName;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "order", fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    private List<Item> items;

    // Getters and Setters
}

@Entity
public class Item {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;

    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @JoinColumn(name = "order_id")
    private Order order;

    // Getters and Setters
}
```

In this example:

- The `items` in `Order` will not be fetched when an `Order` entity is retrieved.
- The `order` in `Item` will not be fetched unless explicitly accessed.

## Testing Lazy Fetching

To test lazy fetching, ensure the persistence context is open when accessing the lazy-loaded fields. In Spring Boot, this is typically done in a transactional method.

### Example Test Case

```java
@Service
public class OrderService {

    @Autowired
    private OrderRepository orderRepository;

    @Transactional
    public void testLazyFetching(Long orderId) {
        Order order = orderRepository.findById(orderId).orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("Order not found"));

        // Accessing lazy-loaded collection
        System.out.println("Order Items: " + order.getItems());
    }
}
```

- **Key Points**:
    - The `@Transactional` annotation ensures the persistence context remains open.
    - Lazy-loaded fields (`order.getItems()`) are fetched when accessed.

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. **LazyInitializationException**

- Occurs when accessing lazy-loaded data outside the persistence context.
- **Solution**: Use `@Transactional` or initialize the data explicitly before the context closes.

```java
Hibernate.initialize(order.getItems());
```

### 2. **N+1 Query Problem**

- Lazy fetching can lead to multiple queries being executed (one for the main entity and additional ones for each associated entity).
- **Solution**: Use `JOIN FETCH` in JPQL or Hibernate queries to fetch data in a single query when necessary.

```java
@Query("SELECT o FROM Order o JOIN FETCH o.items WHERE o.id = :orderId")
Order findByIdWithItems(@Param("orderId") Long orderId);
```

## Best Practices

1. **Choose Fetching Strategy Wisely**:

    - Use `FetchType.LAZY` by default.
    - Optimize using `JOIN FETCH` when specific associations are needed.

2. **Avoid LazyInitializationException**:

    - Ensure lazy-loaded fields are accessed within a transactional context.

3. **Batch Fetching**:

    - For large datasets, use batch fetching to reduce the number of queries.
    - Configure in `application.properties`:
      ```properties
      spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.default_batch_fetch_size=10
      ```

4. **Monitor Performance**:

    - Use tools like Hibernateâ€™s logging or a profiler to identify unnecessary queries.
